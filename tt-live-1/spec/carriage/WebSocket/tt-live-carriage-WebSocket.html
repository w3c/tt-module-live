        A conformant implementation need not implement

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The TTML Live specification [[TTML-LIVE]] defines the payload data for
      live subtitling applications,
      and the requirements for specifying carriage mechanisms for
      transferring live subtitle sequences between nodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document defines one such carriage mechanism,
      based on the WebSocket protocol.
      This protocol provides a way to establish TCP socket connections
      over IP networks in a “web friendly” way that uses
      HTTP upgrades and has a TLS encryption mode.

    <h2>Carriage Specification Details</h2>
    <p>
      WebSocket [[rfc6455]] is a protocol that may be used to transfer a stream of 
      <a>TTML live documents</a> over an IP network from one node to another.
    </p>
    
    <section id="network-dependencies">
      <h3>Core networking dependencies and connection protocols</h3>
      <p>
        WebSocket carriage is based on TCP socket connections
        initiated via an HTTP upgrade request.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        WebSocket does not in itself impose any data rate constraints; 
        such constraints are imposed by the underlying network infrastructure.
        Data payloads are delivered in packets of limited size;
        these do not impact the maximum size of any <a>Live document</a>
        that can be sent.
        The TCP protocol ensures that all data is delivered in order.
        Operational implementations should ensure that there is
        sufficient data rate capacity available to carry the volume of
        TTML Live data needed for the application without imposing growing delay.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Such a growing delay would manifest as
        increasingly late availability times of <a>TTML Live documents</a>,
        which in turn may truncate the visibility
        of presented text or delay its appearance.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="synchronisation-impacts">
      <h3>Synchronisation impacts and/or thresholds</h3>
      
      <p>
        The latency of WebSocket and TCP socket connections
        is generally dependent on the network infrastructure used.
        The protocol guarantees that packets are all delivered,
        and delivered in the same order in which they were sent.
        This guarantee can impose transient additional latency
        if network conditions change.
        For example failure to receive acknowledgement
        of delivery of a packet
        causes further data effectively to be held back
        until that packet can be successfully delivered.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Such an increase in latency would manifest as
        an increased availability time for <a>TTML Live documents</a>,
        which in turn may truncate the visibility of presented text
        or delay its appearance.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Techniques available for handling this include
        careful management of the network conditions,
        for example setting up static routes
        or using software defined networks.
        If such techniques are not locally practical
        then careful consideration should be given
        to decide if WebSocket is indeed
        an appropriate carriage mechanism to use.
      </p>
      
      <p class="note">
        Other network based protocols
        such as those based on UDP
        trade guaranteed delivery for guaranteed latency;
        in some such protocols it is possible for data loss to occur.

        <p>
          Use of the <code>wss:</code> URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)

        <blockquote>
          The WebSocket server can use any
          client authentication mechanism available

          HTTP authentication,

      <section id="error-checking">
        <h4>Error checking and correction</h4>
        <p>
          The WebSocket protocol does not offer
          any inherent error checking and correction.
          As stated in [[rfc6455]] §10.7 Handling of Invalid Data,
          both sending and receiving nodes
          shall validate documents
          and should close the connection if invalid data is received.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          To avoid issues with encoding of
          data with Text data type
          all documents shall be encoded as UTF-8.

      <section id="crossing-boundaries">
        <h4>Crossing organisational boundaries</h4>
        <p>
          The WebSocket protocol facilitates
          transition across organisational boundaries with firewalls etc.
          by using ports that are commonly open for HTTP;
          communication can pass through web proxy servers.
          Use of the secure web socket protocol
          provides a straightforward to use mechanism
          for encrypting communication between organisations
          when the intermediate network is not
          under direct control of either party,
          such as the open internet.

    <section id="endpoint-cardinality">
      <h3>Endpoint cardinality</h3>
      <p>
        WebSocket is a point to point full duplex protocol,
        with connections being defined by two single end points.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Many implementations offer a ‘broadcast’ mode in which
        multiple connections may be made to or from the same endpoint,
        and the same data is sent over each connection.
        Such an implementation could be used to
        provide a Distributing Node for example.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Generally the performance of such implementations is dependent on
        network capacity and processing power;
        for TTML Live applications,
        practical experience shows that small numbers of connections
        (for example, fewer than 10)
        do not impose any significant additional latency on current hardware,
        however care should be taken to ensure that specific applications
        work in the applicable operational environment.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        TTML Live requires only unidirectional flow of data.
        The reverse channel may be used
        for application specific purposes
        if and only if both nodes can validate such application specific data;
        in general this is a risky strategy since
        unexpected data causes connection closure –
        see <a href="#connection-lifecycle"></a> below.
        The reverse channel shall not be used
        for providing an EBU-TT Live stream back
        from a Handover Node;
        such a stream shall be made available using
        a separate (forward) connection.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Implementations should document
        how many simultaneous connections each node supports.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Since connections can be initiated from
        either the Node that sends <a>TTML Live sequences</a>
        or a node that receives them,
        and it is operationally important to know
        which connection “direction” applies,
        implementations shall document whether
        they accept incoming connections
        or make outgoing connections.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        A WebSocket Distributing Node that
        supports incoming connections for both
        receiving and sending
        can be used to mediate between
        implementations that make outgoing connections
        and those that accept incoming connections
        by providing a ‘receiving’ incoming connection
        and offering ‘sending’ connection(s)
        and passing through documents from one to the other
        without modifying them. See <a href="#connection-mediation"></a>.

          to mediate between nodes with
          mutually incompatible connection initiation directions
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Similarly a “connecting” node can mediate in the other direction
        by simultaneously making two outgoing connections,
        one to a “sender” and the other to a “receiver”
        and passing documents from the sender
        to the receiver without modifying them.

    <section id="connection-lifecycle">
      <h3>Connection lifecycle management</h3>
      <p>
        A WebSocket connection is initiated
        when a node dereferences a URI with a
        <code>ws:</code>
        or <code>wss:</code> URI scheme
        whose address resolves to a second node
        that supports the WebSocket Protocol,
        and the WebSocket opening handshake is successfully completed.
        A WebSocket connection is closed when
        either node initiates the closing handshake.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The WebSocket protocol and underlying TCP layer
        maintains established connections
        without further application support being required;
        no keep-alive messages are required by this carriage mechanism.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Nodes should close connections if unexpected
        or invalid data is received.
        Implementations shall support <a>TTML Live documents</a>.
        Implementations shall not close connections
        if valid TTML live documents are received.
        Implementations should document
        any other data formats that they support.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="channel-routing">
      <h3>Channel routing</h3>
      <p>
        This carriage mechanism does not specify or recommend
        any channel routing mechanisms.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Various schemes for maintaining and querying registries of,
        and brokering access to,
        available data sources
        (which could be <a>TTML Live sequences</a>) are feasible and in use.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        It would be reasonable to consider schemes that are
        either coincident with those intended for wider broadcast applications,
        such as the AMWA NMOS Discovery & Registration API [[?ANDR-API]],
        and that are aligned with the
        EBU-sponsored Joint Taskforce on Networked Media Reference Architecture
        [[?JT-NM]].
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Alternatively schemes that are more targeted towards
        a generic WebSocket infrastructure,
        such as the Web Application Messaging Protocol [[?WAMP]]
        may be more appropriate for some applications.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        One practical operational consideration for implementations is
        the design of the WebSocket URI.
        See [[rfc6455]] §12 and [[rfc3986]] for further details.

        “<code>port</code>” to a single specified sequence.
      </aside>

        which may offer multiple resources

        and port without requiring resolution using the DNS system.

        <h4>Sequence Identifier Encoding in URIs</h4>
        <p>
          The data type of <code>ebuttp:sequenceIdentifier</code> is
          <code>xs:string</code> with a minimum length of 1.
          It can therefore contain characters that are reserved in URIs,
          as defined in [[rfc3986]] §2.2.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to inserting into a URI the sequence identifier
          shall be percent-encoded exactly once.
          On extraction from a URI, and prior to use as a sequence identifier,
          the value shall be percent-decoded exactly once.

      <h3>Stability</h3>
      <p>
        WebSocket and TCP guarantee delivery of data
        in the same order in which it was sent
        at the expense of latency if required.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Constant latency can only be achieved by managing
        the underlying network infrastructure.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Given a reliable network infrastructure
        a connection remains open indefinitely
        until either node closes it.
